# Java-soundboard
## GUI  soundboard built using java

Fun Java GUI project from 2016, three tabs in window one with sound buttons on each tab. see photos below. The DJ tab button are also mapped to numbers on keyboard and user can play drums. This was build using eclipse 4.5.2 or mars 2 with Jdk 8 which had the sun.audio library. May have problem running in newer IDE. Archive File export from eclipse provided but in order to use eclipse environment needs to be similar i.e. mars 2 with Jdk 8.
